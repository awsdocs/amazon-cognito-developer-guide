# Creating user accounts as administrator<a name="how-to-create-user-accounts"></a>

After you create your user pool, you can create users using the AWS Management Console, as well as the AWS Command Line Interface or the Amazon Cognito API\. You can create a profile for a new user in a user pool and send a welcome message with sign\-up instructions to the user via SMS or email\.

Developers and administrators can perform the following tasks:
+ Create a new user profile by using the AWS Management Console or by calling the `AdminCreateUser` API\.
+ Specify the temporary password or allow Amazon Cognito to automatically generate one\.
+ Specify whether provided email addresses and phone numbers are marked as verified for new users\.
+ Specify custom SMS and email invitation messages for new users via the AWS Management Console or a Custom Message Lambda trigger\. For more information, see [Customizing user pool workflows with Lambda triggers](cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.md)\.
+ Specify whether invitation messages are sent via SMS, email, or both\.
+ Resend the welcome message to an existing user by calling the `AdminCreateUser` API, specifying `RESEND` for the `MessageAction` parameter\.
**Note**  
This action cannot currently be performed using the AWS Management Console\.
+ Suppress the sending of the invitation message when the user is created\.
+ Specify an expiration time limit for the user account \(up to 90 days\)\.
+ Allow users to sign themselves up or require that new users only be added by the administrator\.

## Authentication flow for users created by administrators or developers<a name="authentication-flow-for-create-user"></a>

The authentication flow for these users includes the extra step to submit the new password and provide any missing values for required attributes\. The steps are outlined next; steps 5, 6, and 7 are specific to these users\.

1. The user starts to sign in for the first time by submitting their user name and password\.

1. The SDK calls `InitiateAuth(Username, USER_SRP_AUTH)`\.

1. Amazon Cognito returns the `PASSWORD_VERIFIER` challenge with Salt & Secret block\.

1. The SDK performs the SRP calculations and calls `RespondToAuthChallenge(Username, <SRP variables>, PASSWORD_VERIFIER)`\.

1. Amazon Cognito returns the `NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED` challenge\. The body of this challenge includes the user's current attributes, and any required attributes in your user pool that don't currently have a value in the user's profile\. For more information, see [RespondToAuthChallenge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_RespondToAuthChallenge.html)\.

1. The user is prompted and enters a new password and any missing values for required attributes\.

1. The SDK calls `RespondToAuthChallenge(Username, <New password>, <User attributes>)`\.

1. If the user requires a second factor for MFA, Amazon Cognito returns the SMS\_MFA challenge and the code is submitted\.

1. After the user has successfully changed his or her password and optionally provided attributed values or completed MFA, the user is signed in and tokens are issued\.

When the user has satisfied all challenges, the Amazon Cognito service marks the user as confirmed and issues ID, access, and refresh tokens for the user\. For more information, see [Using tokens with user pools](amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-with-identity-providers.md)\.

## Creating a new user in the AWS Management Console<a name="creating-a-new-user-using-the-console"></a>

You can set user password requirements, configure the invitation and verification messages sent to users, and add new users with the Amazon Cognito console\.

+ Specify user account expiration time limit \(in days\) for new accounts\. The default setting is 7 days, measured from the time when the user account is created\. The maximum setting is 90 days\. After the account expires, the user cannot log in to the account until the administrator updates the user's profile\.
**Note**  
Once the user has logged in, the account never expires\.

1. Choose the **Sign\-in experience** tab and locate **Password policy**\. Choose **Edit**\.

1. Choose a **Password policy mode** of **Custom**\.

1. Choose a **Password minimum length**\. For limits to the password length requirement, see [User pools resource quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/limits.html#limits-hard)\.

1. Choose a **Password complexity** requirement\.

1. Choose how long password set by administrators should be valid for\.

**Customize user messages**

You can customize the messages that Amazon Cognito sends to your users when you invite them to sign in, they sign up for a user account, or they sign in and are prompted for multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\)\.
**Note**  
An **Invitation message** is sent when you create a user in your user pool and invite them to sign in\. Amazon Cognito sends initial sign\-in information to the user's email address or phone number\.  
A **Verification message** is sent when a user signs up for a user account in your user pool\. Amazon Cognito sends a code to the user\. When the user provides the code to Amazon Cognito, they verify their contact information and confirm their account for sign\-in\. Verification codes are valid for 24 hours\.  
An **MFA message** is sent when you enable SMS MFA in your user pool, and a user that has configured SMS MFA signs in and is prompted for MFA\.

1. Navigate to the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home), and choose **User Pools**\.

**Note**  
For user accounts that you create by using the **Create user** form in the AWS Management Console, only the attributes shown in the form can be set in the AWS Management Console\. Other attributes must be set by using the AWS Command Line Interface or the Amazon Cognito API, even if you have marked them as required attributes\.

#### [ New console ]

**Create a user**

You can create new users for your user pool from the Amazon Cognito console\. Typically, users can sign in after they set a password\. To sign in with an email address, a user must verify the `email` attribute\. To sign in with a phone number, the user must verify the `phone_number` attribute\. To confirm accounts as an administrator, you can also use the AWS CLI or API, or create user profiles with a federated identity provider\. For more information, see the [Amazon Cognito API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/)\.

1. Navigate to the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home), and choose **User Pools**\.

**Note**  
Before you can send invitation messages, configure a sender and an AWS Region with Amazon Simple Notification Service and Amazon Simple Email Service in the **Messaging** tab of your user pool \. Recipient message and data rates apply\. Amazon SES bills you for email messages separately, and Amazon SNS bills you for SMS messages separately\.

1. Choose a **Username** for the new user\.

1. Choose if you want to **Create a password** or have Amazon Cognito **Generate a password** for the user\. Any temporary password must adhere to the user pool password policy\.
