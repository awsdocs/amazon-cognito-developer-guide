# Tagging Amazon Cognito resources<a name="tagging"></a>

A *tag* is a metadata label that you or AWS assigns to an AWS resource\. Each tag consists of a *key* and a *value*\. For tags that you assign, you define the key and value\. For example, you might define the key as `stage` and the value for one resource as `test`\.

Tags help you do the following:
+ Identify and organize your AWS resources\. Many AWS services support tagging, so that you can assign the same tag to resources from different services\. This helps you indicate which resources are related\. For example, you could assign the same tag to an Amazon Cognito user pool that you assign to an Amazon DynamoDB table\.
+ Track your AWS costs\. You can activate these tags on the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard\. AWS uses cost allocation tags to categorize your costs and deliver a monthly cost allocation report to you\. For more information, see [Use cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html) in the *AWS Billing User Guide*\.
+ Control access to your resources based on the tags that are assigned to them\. You can control access by specifying tag keys and values in the conditions for an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policy\. For example, you could allow a user to update a user pool only if the user pool has an `owner` tag with a value of that user's name\. For more information, see [Controlling access using tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

You can use the AWS Command Line Interface or the Amazon Cognito API to add, edit, or delete tags for both user and identity pools\. You can also manage tags for user pools by using the Amazon Cognito console\.

For tips on using tags, see the [AWS tagging strategies](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-tagging-strategies/) post on the *AWS Answers* blog\. 

The following sections provide more information about tags for Amazon Cognito\.

## Supported resources in Amazon Cognito<a name="tagging-supported-resources"></a>

The following resources in Amazon Cognito support tagging: 
+ User pools
+ Identity pools

## Tag restrictions<a name="tagging-restrictions"></a>

The following restrictions apply to tags on Amazon Cognito resources:
+ Maximum number of tags that you can assign to a resource – 50 
+ Maximum key length – 128 Unicode characters 
+ Maximum value length – 256 Unicode characters 
+ Valid characters for keys and values – a\-z, A\-Z, 0\-9, space, and the following characters: \_ \. : / = \+ \- @
+ Keys and values are case sensitive
+ Don't use `aws:` as a prefix for keys; it's reserved for AWS use

## Managing tags using the Amazon Cognito console<a name="tagging-console"></a>

You can use the Amazon Cognito console to manage the tags that are assigned to your user pools\.

The console does not include tagging features for identity pools at this time\. You must manage tags for your identity pools programmatically, such as by using the AWS CLI

------
#### [ Original console ]

**To add tags to a user pool**

1. Open the Amazon Cognito console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito)\. If prompted, enter your AWS credentials\.

1. Choose **Manage User Pools**\.

1. On the **Your User Pools** page, choose the user pool to which you want to add tags\.

1. In the navigation menu, choose **Tags**\.

1. Choose **Add tag** to add your first tag\. If you have previously assigned tags to this user pool, choose **Add another tag**\.

1. Enter values for **Tag Key** and **Tag Value**\.

1. For each additional tag that you want to add, choose **Add another tag**\.

1. When you are finished adding tags, choose **Save changes**\.

On the **Tags** page, you can also edit the keys and values of any existing tags\. To remove a tag, choose the **x** in the top\-right corner of the tag\.

------
#### [ New console ]

**To add tags to a user pool**

1. Navigate to the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home)\. If prompted, enter your AWS credentials\.

1. Choose **User Pools**\.

1. Choose an existing user pool from the list, or [create a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-as-user-directory.html)\.

1. Choose the **User pool properties** tab and locate **Tags**\.

1. Choose **Add tags** to add your first tag\. If you have previously assigned tags to this user pool, in **Manage tags**, chose **Add another**\.

1. Specify values for **Tag Key** and **Tag Value**\.

1. For each additional tag that you want to add, choose **Add another**\.

1. When you are finished adding tags, choose **Save changes**\.

On the **Manage tags** page, you can also edit the keys and values of any existing tags\. To remove a tag, choose **Remove**\.

## AWS CLI examples<a name="tagging-cli-examples"></a>

The AWS CLI provides commands that help you manage the tags that you assign to your Amazon Cognito user pools and identity pools\. 

### Assigning tags<a name="tagging-cli-examples-assigning"></a>

Use the following commands to assign tags to your existing user pools and identity pools\.

**Example `tag-resource` Command for user pools**  
Assign tags to a user pool by using [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cognito-idp/tag-resource.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cognito-idp/tag-resource.html) within the `cognito-idp` set of commands:  

```
$ aws cognito-idp tag-resource \
> --resource-arn user-pool-arn \
> --tags Stage=Test
```
This command includes the following parameters:  
+ `resource-arn` – The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the user pool that you are applying tags to\. To look up the ARN, choose the user pool in the Amazon Cognito console, and view the **Pool ARN** value on the **General settings** tab\.
+ `tags` – The key\-value pairs of the tags, in the format `key=value`\.
To assign multiple tags at once, specify them in a comma\-separated list:  

```
$ aws cognito-idp tag-resource \
> --resource-arn user-pool-arn \
> --tags Stage=Test,CostCenter=80432,Owner=SysEng
```

**Example `tag-resource` Command for identity pools**  
Assign tags to an identity pool by using [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cognito-identity/tag-resource.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cognito-identity/tag-resource.html) within the `cognito-identity` set of commands:  

```
$ aws cognito-identity tag-resource \
> --resource-arn identity-pool-arn \
> --tags Stage=Test
```
This command includes the following parameters:  
+ `resource-arn` – The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the identity pool that you are applying tags to\. To look up the ARN, choose the identity pool in the Amazon Cognito console, and choose **Edit identity pool**\. Then, at **Identity pool ID**, choose **Show ARN**\.
+ `tags` – The key\-value pairs of the tags, in the format `key=value`\.
To assign multiple tags at once, specify them in a comma\-separated list:  

```
$ aws cognito-identity tag-resource \
> --resource-arn identity-pool-arn \
> --tags Stage=Test,CostCenter=80432,Owner=SysEng
```

### Viewing tags<a name="tagging-cli-examples-viewing"></a>

Use the following commands to view the tags that you have assigned to your user pools and identity pools\.
