# Email settings for Amazon Cognito user pools<a name="user-pool-email"></a>

Certain events in your user pool's client app can cause Amazon Cognito to email your users\. For example, if you configure your user pool to require email verification, Amazon Cognito sends an email when a user signs up for a new account in your app or resets their password\. Depending on the action that initiates the email, the email contains a verification code or a temporary password\.

To handle email delivery, you can use either of the following options:
+ [The default email functionality](#user-pool-email-default) that is built into the Amazon Cognito service\.
+ [Your Amazon Simple Email Service \(Amazon SES\) configuration](#user-pool-email-developer)\.

These settings are reversible\. You can update your user pool to switch between them\.

## Default email functionality<a name="user-pool-email-default"></a>

Amazon Cognito can use its default email functionality to handle email deliveries for you\. When you use the default option, Amazon Cognito limits the number of emails it sends each day for your user pool\. For information on service limits, see [Quotas in Amazon Cognito](limits.md)\. For typical production environments, the default email limit is below the required delivery volume\. To enable a higher delivery volume, you can use your Amazon SES email configuration\.

When you use the default functionality, you use Amazon SES resources that are managed by AWS to send email messages\. Amazon SES adds email addresses that return a [hard bounce](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-concepts-deliverability.html#send-email-concepts-deliverability-bounce) to an [account\-level suppression list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-email-suppression-list.html) or a [global suppression list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-concepts-deliverability.html#send-email-concepts-deliverability-suppression-list)\. If an undeliverable email address becomes deliverable later, you can't control its removal from the suppression list while your user pool is configured to use the default functionality\. An email address can remain on the AWS\-managed suppression list indefinitely\. To manage undeliverable email addresses, use your Amazon SES email configuration with an account\-level suppression list, as described in the next section\.

When you use the default email configuration, you can use either of the following email addresses as the FROM address:
+ The default email address, *no\-reply@verificationemail\.com*\.
+ A custom email address\. Before you can use your own email address, you must verify it with Amazon SES and grant Amazon Cognito permission to use this address\.

## Amazon SES email configuration<a name="user-pool-email-developer"></a>

Your application might require a higher delivery volume than what is available with the default option\. To increase the possible delivery volume, use your Amazon SES resources with your user pool to email your users\. You can also [monitor your email sending activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitor-sending-activity.html) when you send email messages with your own Amazon SES configuration\.

Before you can use your Amazon SES configuration, you must verify one or more email addresses, or a domain, with Amazon SES\. Use a verified email address, or an address from a verified domain, as the FROM email address that you assign to your user pool\. When Amazon Cognito sends email to a user, it calls Amazon SES for you and uses your email address\.

When you use your Amazon SES configuration, the following conditions apply:
+ The email delivery limits for your user pool are the same limits that apply to your Amazon SES verified email address in your AWS account\.
+ You can manage your messages to undeliverable email addresses with an account\-level suppression list in Amazon SES that overrides the [global suppression list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-email-concepts-deliverability.html#send-email-concepts-deliverability-suppression-list)\. When you use an account\-level suppression list, email message bounces affect the reputation of your account as a sender\. For more information, see [Using the Amazon SES account\-level suppression list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/sending-email-suppression-list.html) in the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide\.

### Amazon SES email configuration Regions<a name="user-pool-email-developer-region-mapping"></a>

When you choose the AWS Region that contains the Amazon SES resources that you want to use for Amazon Cognito email messages, you can choose the same Region as the one where you created your user pool\. With Amazon Cognito user pools in some Regions, you can also use Amazon SES resources that are in the following alternate Regions: US East \(N\. Virginia\), US West \(Oregon\), or Europe \(Ireland\)\.

To make your email operations faster and more reliable, use the Amazon SES configuration in the AWS Region where you created your user pool\. Support for cross\-Region Amazon SES configuration in Amazon Cognito provides continuity for user pool resources that you created to comply with Amazon Cognito requirements when the service launched\. User pool resources that you created during that period could only use Amazon SES resources in a limited number of AWS Regions\.

**Note**  
In the AWS Management Console, you can only use Amazon SES resources in the same Region after you have switched to the new Amazon Cognito console experience\.

If you create an Amazon Cognito user pools resource with the AWS Command Line Interface, API, or AWS CloudFormation, your user pool sends email messages with the Amazon SES identity that the `SourceArn` parameter of the [EmailConfigurationType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_EmailConfigurationType.html) object specifies for your user pool\. The Amazon SES identity must occupy a supported AWS Region\. If your `EmailSendingAccount` is `COGNITO_DEFAULT` and you don't specify a `SourceArn` parameter, Amazon Cognito sends email messages from `no-reply@verificationemail.com` using resources in the Region where you created your user pool\.

The following table shows the AWS Regions where you can use Amazon SES identities with Amazon Cognito\.


| Amazon Cognito user pools AWS Region | Amazon Simple Email Service supported AWS Regions | 
| --- | --- | 
|  US East \(N\. Virginia\)  |  US East \(N\. Virginia\), US West \(Oregon\), Europe \(Ireland\)  |

## Configuring email for your user pool<a name="user-pool-email-configure"></a>

Complete the following steps to configure the email settings for your user pool\. Depending on the settings that you use, you might need IAM permissions in Amazon SES, AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\), and Amazon Cognito\.

**Note**  
You can't share the resources that you create in these steps across AWS accounts\. For example, you can't configure a user pool in one account, and then use it with an Amazon SES email address in a different account\. If you use Amazon Cognito in multiple accounts, repeat these steps for each account\.

### Step 1: Verify your email address or domain with Amazon SES<a name="user-pool-email-configure-verify-ses"></a>

Before you configure your user pool, you must verify one or more domains or email addresses with Amazon SES if you want to do either of the following:
+ Use your own email address as the FROM address
+ Use your Amazon SES configuration to handle email delivery

By verifying your email address or domain, you confirm that you own it, which helps prevent unauthorized use\.

For information on verifying an email address with Amazon SES, see [Verifying an Email Address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses-procedure.html) in the *Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide*\. For information on verifying a domain with Amazon SES, see [Verifying domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-domains.html)\.

### Step 2: Move your account out of the Amazon SES sandbox<a name="user-pool-email-configure-sandbox"></a>

Omit this step if you are using the default Amazon Cognito email functionality\.

When you first use Amazon SES in any AWS Region, it places your AWS account in the Amazon SES sandbox for that Region\. Amazon SES uses the sandbox to prevent fraud and abuse\. If you use your Amazon SES configuration to handle email delivery, you must move your AWS account out of the sandbox before Amazon Cognito can email your users\.

In the sandbox, Amazon SES imposes restrictions on how many emails you can send and where you can send them\. You can send emails only to addresses and domains that you have verified with Amazon SES, or you can send them to Amazon SES mailbox simulator addresses\. While your AWS account remains in the sandbox, don't use your Amazon SES configuration for applications that are in production\. In this situation, Amazon Cognito can't send messages to your users' email addresses\.

To remove your AWS account from the sandbox, see [Moving out of the Amazon SES sandbox](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html) in the *Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide\.*

### Step 3: Grant email permissions to Amazon Cognito<a name="user-pool-email-permissions"></a>

You might need to grant specific permissions to Amazon Cognito before it can email your users\. The permissions that you grant, and the process that you use to grant them, depend on whether you are using the default email functionality, or your Amazon SES configuration\.

#### To grant permissions to use the default email functionality<a name="user-pool-email-permissions-default"></a>

Omit this step only if you're using the default Amazon Cognito email functionality\.

If you configure your user pool to use the default Amazon Cognito' email functionality, you can use either of the following addresses as the FROM address from which Amazon Cognito emails your users:
+ The default address
+ A custom address, which must be a verified email address, or an email address in a verified domain, in Amazon SES

If you use a custom address, Amazon Cognito needs additional permissions to email users from that address\. These permissions are granted by a *sending authorization policy* attached to the address or domain in Amazon SES\. If you use the Amazon Cognito console to add a custom address to your user pool, the policy is automatically attached to the Amazon SES verified email address\. However, if you configure your user pool outside of the console, such as using the AWS CLI or the Amazon Cognito API, you must attach the policy using the [Amazon SES console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/) or the [PutIdentityPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/API_PutIdentityPolicy.html) API\.

**Note**  
You can only configure a FROM address in a verified domain using the AWS CLI or the Amazon Cognito API\.

A sending authorization policy allows or denies access based on the account resources that are using Amazon Cognito to invoke Amazon SES\. For more information about resource\-based policies, see the [IAM User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_resource-based)\. You can also find example resource\-based policies in the [Amazon SES Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization-policy-examples.html)\.

**Example Sending authorization policy**  
The following example sending authorization policy grants Amazon Cognito a limited ability to use an Amazon SES verified identity\. Amazon Cognito can only send email messages when it does so on behalf of both the user pool in the `aws:SourceArn` condition and the account in the `aws:SourceAccount` condition\.  

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "stmnt1234567891234",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": [
                    "email.cognito-idp.amazonaws.com"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "SES:SendEmail",
                "SES:SendRawEmail"
            ],
            "Resource": "<your SES identity ARN>",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceAccount": "<your account number>"
                },
                "ArnLike": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "<your user pool ARN>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
In this example, the "Sid" value is an arbitrary string that uniquely identifies the statement\.   
For more information about policy syntax, see [Amazon SES sending authorization policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization-policies.html) in the *Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide*\.  
For more examples, see [Amazon SES sending authorization policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization-policy-examples.html) in the *Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide*\.

**Example**  

#### To grant permissions to use your Amazon SES configuration<a name="user-pool-email-permissions-developer"></a>

If you configure your user pool to use your Amazon SES configuration, Amazon Cognito needs additional permissions to call Amazon SES on your behalf when it emails your users\. This authorization is granted with the IAM service\.

When you configure your user pool with this option, Amazon Cognito creates a *service\-linked role*, which is a type of IAM role, in your AWS account\. This role contains the permissions that allow Amazon Cognito to access Amazon SES and send email with your address\.

Before Amazon Cognito can create this role, the IAM permissions that you use to set up your user pool must include the `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` action\. For more information about permissions in IAM, see [Access management for AWS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

For more information about the service\-linked role that Amazon Cognito creates, see [Using service\-linked roles for Amazon Cognito](using-service-linked-roles.md)\.

### Step 4: Configure your user pool<a name="user-pool-email-configure"></a>

Complete the following steps if you want to configure your user pool with any of the following:
+ A custom FROM address that appears as the email sender
+ A custom REPLY\-TO address that receives the messages that your users send to your FROM address
+ Your Amazon SES configuration

Omit this procedure if you want to use the default Amazon Cognito email functionality and address\.

------
#### [ Original console ]

**To configure your user pool to use a custom email address**
