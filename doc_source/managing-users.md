# Managing users in your user pool<a name="managing-users"></a>

After you create a user pool, you can create, confirm, and manage user accounts\. With Amazon Cognito user pools groups you can manage your users and their access to resources by mapping IAM roles to groups\.

You can import your users into a user pool with a user migration Lambda trigger\. This approach enables seamless migration of users from your existing user directory to user pools when they sign in to your user pool for the first time\.
