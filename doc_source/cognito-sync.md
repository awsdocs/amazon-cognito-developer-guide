****  
If you're new to Amazon Cognito Sync, use [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/)\. Like Amazon Cognito Sync, AWS AppSync is a service for synchronizing application data across devices\.  
It enables user data like app preferences or game state to be synchronized\. It also extends these capabilities by allowing multiple users to synchronize and collaborate in real time on shared data\.

 Amazon Cognito Sync is an AWS service and client library that enables cross\-device syncing of application\-related user data\. You can use it to synchronize user profile data across mobile devices and the web without requiring your own backend\. The client libraries cache data locally so your app can read and write data regardless of device connectivity status\. When the device is online, you can synchronize data, and if you set up push sync, notify other devices immediately that an update is available\. 

 For information about Amazon Cognito Identity region availability, see [AWS Service Region Availability](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)\.
