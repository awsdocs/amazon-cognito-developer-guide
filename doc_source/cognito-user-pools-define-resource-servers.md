# Defining resource servers for your user pool<a name="cognito-user-pools-define-resource-servers"></a>

After you configure a domain for your user pool, Amazon Cognito automatically provisions a hosted web UI with sign\-up and sign\-in pages that your app can present to your users\. For more information see [Step 2\. Add an app client and set up the hosted UI](cognito-user-pools-configuring-app-integration.md)\.

A *resource server* is an [OAuth 2\.0 API server](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/the-resource-server/)\. To secure access\-protected resources, it verifies access tokens from your app and authorizes access to your API\. It verifies the issuer based on the token signature, validity based on token expiration, and access level based on the scopes in token claims\.

A resource server API might grant access to the information in a database, or control your IT resources\. An Amazon Cognito access token can authorize access to APIs that support OAuth 2\.0\. Amazon API Gateway REST APIs have [built\-in support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.html) for authorization with Amazon Cognito access tokens\. Your app passes the access token in the API call to the resource server\. The app should treat the access token as opaque when it passes the token in the access request\. The resource server inspects the access token to determine if access should be granted\. 

**Note**  
Your resource server must verify the access token signature and expiration date before processing any claims inside the token\. For more information about verifying and using user pool tokens, see [Integrating Amazon Cognito User Pools with API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/integrating-amazon-cognito-user-pools-with-api-gateway/) on the *AWS Blog*\. Amazon API Gateway is a good option for inspecting access tokens and protecting your resources\. For more about API Gateway Lambda authorizers, see [Use API Gateway Lambda authorizers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.html)\.

A *scope* is a level of access that an app can request to a resource\. For example, if you have a resource server for photos, it might define two scopes: one for read access to the photos and one for write/delete access\. When the app makes an API call to request access and passes an access token, the token will have one or more scopes embedded inside of it\.

**Overview**

With Amazon Cognito, app developers can create their own OAuth2\.0 resource servers and associate custom scopes with them\. Associate your custom scopes with an app client, and your app can request those scopes in OAuth2\.0 authorization code grants, implicit grants, and client credentials grants from the [Token endpoint](token-endpoint.md)\. Amazon Cognito passes custom scopes in the `scope` claim in an access token\. A client can use the access token against its resource server, which makes the authorization decision based on the scopes present in the token\. For more information about access token scope, see [Using Tokens with User Pools](amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-with-identity-providers.md)\.

To get an access token with custom scopes, your app must make a request to the [Token endpoint](token-endpoint.md) to redeem an authorization code or to request a client credentials grant\. In the hosted UI, you can also request custom scopes in an access token from an implicit grant\.

**Note**  
Because they are designed for human\-interactive authentication, [InitiateAuth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_InitiateAuth.html) and [AdminInitiateAuth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_AdminInitiateAuth.html) requests produce access tokens that don't contain any custom scopes\.

**Managing the Resource Server and Custom Scopes**

When creating a resource server, you must provide a resource server name and a resource server identifier\. For each scope you create in the resource server, you must provide the scope name and description\.

Example:
+ `Name`: A friendly name for the resource server, such as `Weather API` or `Photo API`\.
+ `Identifier`: A unique identifier for the resource server\. This can be an HTTPS endpoint where your resource server is located\. For example, `https://my-weather-api.example.com`
+ `Scope Name`: The scope name\. For example, `weather.read`
+ `Scope Description`: A brief description the scope\. For example, `Retrieve weather information`\.

When a client app requests a custom scope in any of the OAuth2\.0 flows, it must request the full identifier for the scope, which is `resourceServerIdentifier/scopeName`\. For example, if the resource server identifier is `https://myphotosapi.example.com` and the scope name is `photos.read`, the client app must request `https://myphotosapi.example.com/photos.read` at runtime\.

Deleting a scope from a resource server does not delete its association with all clients; instead, the scope is marked inactive\. If a client app requests the deleted scope at runtime, the scope is ignored and is not included in the access token\. If the scope is re\-added later, then it is again included in the access token\.

If a scope is removed from a client, the association between client and scope is deleted\. If a client requests a disallowed scope at runtime, an error is returned and an access token isn't issued\.

You can use the AWS Management Console, API, or CLI to define resource servers and scopes for your user pool\.

## Defining a resource server for your user pool \(AWS Management Console\)<a name="cognito-user-pools-define-resource-servers-console"></a>

You can use the AWS Management Console to define a resource server for your user pool\.

------
#### [ Original console ]

**To define a resource server**

1. Sign in to the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home)\. If prompted, enter your AWS credentials\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Manage User Pools**, and then choose the user pool you want to edit\.

1. Choose the **Resource servers** tab\.

1. Choose **Add a resource server**\.

1. Enter the name of your resource server\. For example, `Photo Server`\.

1. Enter the identifier of your resource server\. For example, `com.example.photos`\.
