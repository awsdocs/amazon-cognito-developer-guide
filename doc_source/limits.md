# Quotas in Amazon Cognito<a name="limits"></a>

Amazon Cognito has default quotas, formerly referred to as *limits*, for the maximum number of operations that you can perform in your account\. Amazon Cognito also has quotas for the maximum number and size of Amazon Cognito resources\.

Each Amazon Cognito quota represents a maximum volume of requests in one AWS Region, in one AWS account\. For example, your apps can make API requests at *up to* the **Default quota \(RPS\)** rate for `UserAuthentication` operations against all of your user pools in US East \(N\. Virginia\)\. Your apps in Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\) can produce the same volume of requests against all of your user pools in their own Region\. AWS can only grant a quota increase request in one Region at a time\. A successful quota increase in US East \(N\. Virginia\) has no effect on your maximum request rate in Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\)\.

## Understanding API request rate quotas<a name="operation-quotas"></a>

### Quota categorization<a name="quota-categorization"></a>

Amazon Cognito sets a maximum request rate for API operations\. For more information about the API operations that Amazon Cognito makes available, see [Amazon Cognito API references](cognito-reference.md) For user pools, these operations are grouped into categories of common use cases like `UserAuthentication` or `UserCreation`\. For a list of API operations by category, see [Amazon Cognito user pools API operation categories and request rate quotas](#category_operations)\. You can track your user pool quota usage, and request increases, by category in the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home)\.

Operation quotas are defined as the maximum number of requests per second \(RPS\) for all operations within a category\. The Amazon Cognito user pools service applies quotas to all operations in each category\. For example, the category `UserCreation` includes four operations: `SignUp`, `ConfirmSignUp`, `AdminCreateUser`, and `AdminConfirmSignUp`\. It's allocated with a combined quota of 50 RPS\. If multiple operations take place at the same time, each operation within this category can call up to 50 RPS separately or combined\. 

**Note**  
Category quotas only apply to user pools\. Amazon Cognito applies each identity pool quota to a single operation\. For both per\-category and per\-operation request rate quotas, AWS measures the aggregate of all requests from all user pools or identity pools in your AWS account in one AWS Region\.

### Amazon Cognito user pools API operations with special request rate handling<a name="api-operation-special-handling"></a>

Operation quotas are measured and enforced for the combined total requests at the category level, except for the `AdminRespondToAuthChallenge` and `RespondToAuthChallenge` operations, where special handling rules are applied\. 

The `UserAuthentication` category includes four operations: `AdminInitiateAuth`, `InitiateAuth`, `AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`, and `RespondToAuthChallenge`\. The `InitiateAuth` and `AdminInitiateAuth` operations are measured and enforced per category quota\. The matching operations `RespondToAuthChallenge` and `AdminRespondToAuthChallenge` are subject to a separate quota that is three times the `UserAuthentication` category limit\. This elevated quota accommodates multiple authentication challenges set up in developersâ€™ apps\. The quota is sufficient to cover the large majority of use cases\. Beyond the three\-times\-per\-authentication\-call threshold, the excess rate counts towards the `UserAuthentication` category quota\.

For example, if your quota for the `UserAuthentication` category is 80 RPS, you can call `RespondToAuthChallenge` or `AdminRespondToAuthChallenge` up to 240 RPS \(80 RPS x 3\)\. If the app is set up to have four rounds of challenge per authentication call and you have 70 sign\-ins per second, then the total `RespondToAuthChallenge` is 280 RPS \(70 x 4\), which is 40 RPS above the quota\. The extra 40 RPS is added to 70 `InitiateAuth` calls, making the total usage of `UserAuthentication` category 110 RPS \(40 \+ 70\)\. This value exceeds the category quota set at 80 RPS by 30 RPS, so this app is throttled\.

### Monthly active users<a name="monthly-active-users"></a>

Monthly active users \(MAUs\) are the benchmark by which Amazon Cognito user pools billing is calculated\. MAUs are also used to determine if your user pool is eligible for a quota increase\. A user is counted as a MAU if, within a calendar month, there is an identity operation related to that user, such as sign\-up, sign\-in, token refresh, password change, or a user account attribute is updated\. Amazon Cognito also counts a user as active in the month that you take an action that deactivates or deletes the user or its attributes\.

## Managing API request rate quotas<a name="managing-request-rate-quotas"></a>

### Identify quota requirements<a name="identify-quota-requirements"></a>

**Important**  
If you increase Amazon Cognito quotas for categories such as `UserAuthentication`, `UserCreation`, or `AccountRecovery`, you may need to increase quotas for other services\. For example, messages that Amazon Cognito sends with Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) or Amazon Simple Email Service \(Amazon SES\) can fail if request rate quotas are insufficient in those services\.

To calculate quota requirements, determine how many active users will interact with your application in a specific time period\. For example, if you expect your application to sign in an average of one million active users within an eight\-hour period, then you must be able to authenticate an average of 35 users per second\. 

In addition, if you assume that the average user session is two hours, and you configure tokens to expire after an hour, each user must refresh their tokens once during their session\. The required average quota for the `UserAuthentication` category to support this load is 70 RPS\.

If you assume a peak\-to\-average ratio of 3:1 by accounting for the variance of user sign\-in frequency during the eight\-hour period, then you need the desired `UserAuthentication` quota of 200 RPS\. 

**Note**  
If you call multiple operations for each user action, you must sum up the individual operation call rates at the category level\.

### Optimize quotas<a name="optimize-quotas"></a>

Follow one of the following methods to handle a peak call rate\.

**Retry the attempt after a back\-off waiting period**  
You can catch errors with each API call, and then re\-try the attempt after a back\-off period\. You can adjust the back\-off algorithm according to business needs and load\. Amazon SDKs have built\-in retry logic\. For more information, see [ Tools to Build on AWS\.](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/ ) 

**Use an external database for frequently updated attributes**  
If your application requires several calls to a user pool to read or write custom attributes, use external storage\. You can use your preferred database to store custom attributes or use a cache layer to load a user profile during sign\-in\. You can reference this profile from the cache when needed, instead of reloading the user profile from a user pool\.

**Validate JWT tokens on the client side**  
Applications must validate JWT tokens before trusting them\. You can verify the signature and validity of tokens on the client side without sending API calls to a user pool\. After the token is validated, you can trust claims in the token and use the claims instead of making more `getUser` API calls\. For more information, see [ Verifying a JSON Web Token\.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-verifying-a-jwt.html)

**Throttle traffic to your web application with a waiting room**  
If you expect traffic from a large number of users signing in during a time\-bound event, such as taking an exam or attending a live event, you can optimize request traffic with self\-throttling mechanisms\. You can, for example, set up a waiting room where users can stand by until a session is available, allowing you to process requests when you have available capacity\. See the [AWS Virtual Waiting Room solution](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/aws-virtual-waiting-room) for a reference architecture of a waiting room\. 

### Track quota usage<a name="track-quota-usage"></a>

Amazon Cognito generates `CallCount` and `ThrottleCount` metrics in Amazon CloudWatch for each API operation category at the account level\. You can use `CallCount` to track the total number of calls customers made related to a category\. You can use `ThrottleCount` to track the total number of throttled calls related to a category\. You can use the `CallCount` and `ThrottleCount` metrics with the `Sum` statistic to count the total number of calls in a category\. For more information, see [CloudWatch usage metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html)\.

When monitoring service quotas, *utilization* is the percentage of a service quota in use\. For example, if the quota value is 200 resources, and 150 resources are in use, the utilization is 75%\. *Usage* is the number of resources or operations in use for a service quota\.

**Tracking usage through CloudWatch metrics**

You can track and collect Amazon Cognito user pools utilization metrics using CloudWatch\. The CloudWatch dashboard displays metrics about every AWS service that you use\. With CloudWatch, you can create metric alarms to notify you or change a specific resource that you are monitoring\. For more information about CloudWatch metrics, see [Track your CloudWatch usage metrics](tracking-quotas-and-usage-in-cloud-watch-and-service-quotas.md)\.

**Tracking utilization through Service Quotas metrics**

Amazon Cognito user pools are integrated with Service Quotas, which is a browser\-based interface that you can use to view and manage your service quota usage\. In the Service Quotas console, you can look up the value of a specific quota, view monitoring information, request a quota increase, or set up CloudWatch alarms\. After your account has been active a while, you can view a graph of your resource utilization\.

For more information on viewing quotas in the Service Quotas console, see [Viewing Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/gs-request-quota.html)\. 

### Requesting a quota increase<a name="api-request-rate-quotas"></a>

Amazon Cognito has a quota for the maximum number of user pool operations that you can perform in your account\. You can request an increase to the adjustable API request rate quotas in Amazon Cognito\. To request a quota increase, use the Service Quotas console, the Service limit increase form, or the `RequestServiceQuotaIncrease` or `ListAWSDefaultServiceQuotas` API operations\.
+ To request a quota increase using the Service Quotas console, see [Requesting a API quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\.
+ If the quota isn't available in Service Quotas, use the [Service limit increase form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase)\.

**Important**  
Only adjustable quotas can be increased\. Quota increase requests are evaluated based on current utilization, existing or expected MAUs, and your implementation of optimization best practices\. When you submit a quota increase request, provide as much information about your current usage, projected usage, and optimization methods as you are able to\. For quota increases that increase your request rate, your current average request rate should already be close to the maximum rate at your current quota\. See [Amazon Cognito user pools API operation categories and request rate quotas](#category_operations) to learn more about adjustable quotas\.   
Consider an example scenario where your application is growing to 5 million MAUs\. Your current average utilization in the UserAuthentication category operations is high: 60%, or 72 requests per second against your current quota of 120\. You can request a UserAuthentication quota increase for 40 requests per second for each of the 3 million MAUs above the first two million, bringing your quota to a maximum of 240 requests per second\.

## Amazon Cognito user pools API operation categories and request rate quotas<a name="category_operations"></a>

Because Amazon Cognito has overlapping classes of API operations with [differing authorization models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pools-API-operations.html), each operation belongs to a category\. Each category has its own pooled quota for all member API operations, across all user pools in one AWS Region in your account\. You can only request an increase to *adjustable* category quotas\. For more information, see [Requesting a quota increase](#api-request-rate-quotas)\. Quota adjustments apply to the user pools in your account in a single Region\. Amazon Cognito restricts operations in some categories1 to 5 requests per second \(RPS\), per user pool\. The **Default quota \(RPS\)** additionally applies to all user pools in an account\.

**Note**  
The quota for each category is measured in Monthly Active Users \(MAUs\)\. AWS accounts with fewer than two million MAUs can operate within the default quota\. If you have less than one million MAUs, you shouldn't request a quota increase\. 

Category operation quotas are applied across all users in all user pools within one AWS Region\. Amazon Cognito also maintains a quota for the number of requests that your app can generate against one user\. You must limit per\-user API requests as shown in the following table\.

**Amazon Cognito user pools per\-user request rate quotas**


| Operation | Operations per user per second | 
| --- | --- | 
| Read user profileExamples: `AdminInitiateAuth`, `GetUser`, `GetDevice` | 10 | 
| Write user profileExamples: `UpdateUserAttributes`, `SetUserSettings`, `AdminLinkProviderForUser` | 10 | 

You must limit per\-category API requests as shown in the following table\.

1 Any individual operation in this category has a constraint that prevents the operation from being called at a rate higher than 5 RPS for a single user pool\.

2 Request rate for all user pools with fewer than 2 million MAUs\.

3 Request rate increases will be considered when you have between 1 million and 10 million MAUs\. Quota increase requests are evaluated based on current utilization, existing or expected MAUs, and your implementation of optimization best practices\.Amazon Cognito reserves the right to deny quota increase requests to prevent misuse and protect service availability for all customers\. If you have more than 10 million MAUs, we recommend that you work with an AWS solutions architect to design your solution in a way that is optimized for Amazon Cognito quotas\. Please contact your AWS account team for help\.

## Quotas on resource number and size<a name="resource-quotas"></a>

Resource quotas are the maximum number or size of resources, input fields, time duration, and other miscellaneous features in Amazon Cognito\.

You can request an adjustment to some resource quotas in the Service Quotas console or from a [Service limit increase form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase)\. To request a quota from the Service Quotas console, see [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*\. If the quota isn't available in Service Quotas, use the [Service limit increase form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase)\.

**Note**  
Resource quotas at the AWS account level, like *User pools per account*, apply to Amazon Cognito resources in each AWS Region\. For example, you can have 1,000 user pools in US East \(N\. Virginia\) and another 1,000 in Europe \(Stockholm\)\.

The following tables indicate default resource quotas, and whether they're adjustable\.
